For this assignment I created a quiz utilizing what I learned the past week about JavaScript. Once the user clicks on the start quitz button a timer starts counting down from 60 seconds. For each incorrect answer 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer. Once the quiz is complete the final time is the score. The user then adds their initials, which is stored along with their score on the high scores page, where each stored score is in order from highest to lowest.
